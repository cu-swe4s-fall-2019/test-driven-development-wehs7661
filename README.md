# Test-driven Development (TDD)

## Description
This is a repository for Assignment 3 of the course Software Engineering for Scientise (CSCI7000) at CU Boulder, which includes the following files:
- `math_lib.py`: a python library of simple mathematic operations 
- `test_mat_lib.py`: a Python code for unit testing of `math_lib.py`
- `gen_data.sh`: a shell script for generating data for plotting, which serves as `stdin` to `get_data.py`.
- `get_data.py`: a Python module which includes the method `read_stdin_col read` that read in the output of `gen_data.sh` as `stdin` and process the data following the user input
- `test_get_data.py`: a Python code for unit test of `get_data.py`


## Installation
All the Python scripts are written in Python 3 and the packages required to run the codes include: `math`, `unittest`, `random`, `sys`, and `statistics`.

## Usage
- Execution of the main program

- Unit testing 
  - To test `math_lib.py`, run the command `python test_math_lib.py`
  - To test `get_data.py`, run the command `bash gen_data.sh | python test_get_data.py`

- Functional testing


## Changes made upon the starter code of Assignment 3
- Created `math_lib.py`, which is a library for simple mathematic operations
- Createdd `test_math_lib.py`, which is a Python code including 8 test methods for the unit testing of `math_lib.py`.
- Created `get_data.py`, which is a library with only one method getting the data from `stdin` generated by `gen_data.py`
- Created `test_get_data.py`, which is a Python code including 2 test methods for the unit testing of `get_data.py`
